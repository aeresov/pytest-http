# tooling

- use `uv` package manager
- use `ruff` for all linting and formatting
- use `pytest` for running unit tests

# guidelines

- add unit tests for code edits

# playground rules

- do not edit dependencies directly in `pyproject.toml`, use package manager
- do not lint and format code directly, use tools
