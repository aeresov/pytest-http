# purpose

- each file contains a multistaged test scenario for this plugin to read, validate and execute

# guidelines

- file naming must follow the pattern `test_<name>.http.json`
- file contents use `$ref` for referencing blocks, including other files content (via jsonref)
- file contents is validated against Pydantic models in steps:
    - general test settings: `pytest-http/models:Structure`
    - test scenario: `pytest-http/models:Structure`
